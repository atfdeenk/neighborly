# Neighborly — Video Presentation Script

---

## 1. Introduction
Hello everyone,  
My name is [Your Name], and today I’m excited to present **Neighborly** — a core component of the Sustainable Community Market Platform.

Neighborly is a web-based platform designed to connect local communities with sustainable products, supporting local producers and reducing our collective carbon footprint.

---

## 2. Problem Statement & Objective
Many local producers and artisans struggle to reach nearby consumers, leading to economic challenges and increased reliance on long-distance shipping.  
Neighborly addresses this by providing a digital marketplace where local sellers and consumers can easily connect, trade, and promote sustainable practices.

Our goal was to create a modular, extensible MVP that can be further developed by our group and integrated into a larger ecosystem.

## 3. Tech Stack & Architecture
Neighborly is built with:
- **Next.js** (App Router, TypeScript) for a modern, scalable front-end
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid, responsive UI development
- **Mock data and services** to simulate real-world e-commerce flows

The project is structured for clean code, easy collaboration, and future back-end integration.

## 4. Key Features & User Flows
Let’s walk through the main features:

### a. Authentication & Roles
- Users can register and log in as either **Consumers** or **Sellers**.
- Role-based access ensures sellers and buyers have the right permissions and experience.

### b. Market Discovery

### d. Checkout & Review
- The checkout page simulates payment and order confirmation.
- After purchase, users are prompted to leave a 5-star review, helping future buyers.
